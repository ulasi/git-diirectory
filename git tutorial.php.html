    <!--------------------------------directory works--------------------------------------------------->
check version :git --version
enter username:λ git config --global user.name ulasivinent
enter email:λ git config --global user.email saitek3032@gmail.com

chang directory cd (shows git installation  folder)
:cd ..


change to a particuler directory eg \Users\ezeem\Desktop\commander
:cd commander

list the content of current directory
:ls 

make a new directory(eg newdir) inside commander
mkdir newdir

upper directory eg commander
cd .. 

to select any f the directory (eg newdir) use cd dirname
cd newdir

make a new file in any directory eg newdir directory
touch newfile.php

press ls to see new file
:ls 

open this file with any text editor eg atom 
atom.newfile.php 

delete a file eg newfile.php 
: rm newfile.php

go up directory 
cd ..

delete directory eg newdir 
: rmdir newdir 

copy and paste directry path eg C:\xampp\htdocs 
cd C:\xampp\htdocs 

use the current dir as ur repository 
:git init 

any diretory u great as repo,file being traced turns green <br>
git track all file and file in subdirectory of the repo folder.the green color means the file was changed or modified but not 
commited, you must move a file in the staging area b4 pressing commit.ie all staged file will be commited when commit is pressed.
modified =green 
    <!----------------------------------staging and commit------------------------------------------------->

to see modified,staged,commited 
:git status

use add to add a file(eg txt.txt) to staging area for commits 
:git add txt.txt

to remove a staged file eg txt.txt 
git rm --cached txt.txt

add all file in a folder to staging area 
:git add . 

commiting staged file
-m mean message,the note helps u remember the changes u added from last commit 
:git commit -m "note of changes u made"

commited files changes to orange,u get a meesge showing 
commit message 
id of the commit 
fiels changd :number of file commited 
insertions: code lines that changed
deletion: number of lines u deleted  
commit color:orange 

see all commits 

:git log

the above giv adetail info with long commit ids ,press q to return to cmd input 
for shorter info,use 

:git log --oneline
this list short id with the messge reminder 
    <!-------------------selecting commit------------------rewinding tracking back to use---------------------------------------------->

rewinding ,undoing to a particular commit stage,
there are 3 approach to going back to a commit history 

1)checkout commit:safest, the commit history is unaltered 
2) revert commit deletes only the reverted commit,leaving the rest of the stages 
3)reset commit: reset the whole commit history to the a particular stage or commit u choosed 

so use 
:git log --oneline
to list the ids

code for checkout commited 
:git checkout commit_id 

the HEAD tag is giving to the latest commit u made
rewinfing to a previous comit detaches the head from the master(most recent commit) to that commit 
to go back to master use
: git checkout master 

revert 
: git revert commit-id 
this brings up promppt to enter commit messege,ignore it and press shift+;
: :wq
this return u to the command interface 
on pressing git log --oneline ul notice a new commit is created as HEAD and former one still retained 
the new commit actually revert all changes u do in the old commit 

reset commit ,there are two forms of this 

1)below form delete  our commit history to the commit selected
but it still retains our head or master.ie our current work b4 the revert 
this is good if u want to add all ur comit to one ,ie current progress 
:git reset commit_id 

2)below form will not retain our current progress,do at ur own risk
:git reset commit_id --hard

    <!------------------------------------BRANCHING----------------------------------------------->

ctreating branches 
the master branche is the main commit history 
we can create a branch of history out of the master branch 
use this code to list branches (notice only master branch is listed ),active branch is in green
:git branch -a 

create  a branch (eg branche1)
:git branch branch-Name 

to use or change to another branch (eg branche1)
:git checkout branch_name

to create a branch and switch to it at once 
:git checkout -b branch_name 


deleting a branch 
first change to another branch use the below codes 
git branch -d branche1 
git branch -D branche1 (if the branch is not mearged yet )

    <!--------------------------------------merging branch to the master --------------------------------------------->
    merging is adding our progree in branch back to the master branch which is our production branch 

recall to see all branches 
:git branch -a 

to mearch a branch to master,first switch to master() and the me
